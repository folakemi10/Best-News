## Creative Portion
We decided to implement:
* Confirm password function when registering/signing up
* Account Page where user can see all the stories and comments they wrote
* Upvote stories: stories will be ordered in the number of points they have been awarded (stories with the highest points are at the top)
* Delete a user, which will remove all stories and comments associated with that username, and remove that user from the database

Grade:

Full Points
